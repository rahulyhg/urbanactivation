400	Local Carlton, VIC	Contemporary and stylish open-plan interiors are in keeping with the Local Carlton lifestyle. 	        <span class="heading">It's no secret. Locals know that Carlton is a fantastic place to live. There's a great meal around every corner any time of day. </span><br><br>Follow your nose to that roasting coffee bean aroma and find stunningly good coffee. Spend a leisurely hour or two in one of the many European-style public squares or pop over to Carlton Gardens for a picnic or a game of tennis. Visit the world heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. Slip into the Melbourne Museum or Imax. Take just a few minutes to head into the CBD or nearby RMIT. <br><br>Tram stops are a stone's throw away in almost every direction. Just across Elgin St you can immerse yourself in an exciting concentration of shops, restaurants, cinemas, pubs and bars. There's the famous La Mama Theatre, Melbourne University, the Italian vibe of Lygon St and eclectic atmosphere of Brunswick St. All of it is a short stroll away. <br><br>Contemporary and stylish open-plan interiors are in keeping with the Local Carlton lifestyle. Timber flooring and the warm ambience of natural light enable each apartment to take on a myriad of moods, day and night. From fresh mornings to mellow afternoons, natural tones give every space an adaptable character designed to fit readily with your sense of style. <br><br>A range of apartment styles – from studio to three bedrooms – feature flexible layouts and an abundance of natural light and ventilation. Most street-facing ground floor apartments have courtyard entries directly from the footpath, with landscaped low walls that provide a dynamic re-imagining of the classic Carlton streetscape.<br><br>Carlton is famous for its squares and piazzas. Australand is proud to announce an offering unique for a modern urban development: a new public park. Inspired by the historic landscape types found in Carlton, the park harmonises two components, the square and the street.

419	108 Flinders, Melbourne, VIC	Your restful haven and calm retreat right in the heart of the Federation Square precinct.  	It’s hard to imagine an address that better positions you to experience all the advantages of inner city living than 108 Flinders Street. Inspired by this ‘very Melbourne’ location, Melbourne’s very own Fender Katsalidis Architects has designed a building to rival their trio of residential city landmarks in Melbourne Terrace, Republic Tower and Eureka Tower.<BR><BR>Although unashamedly modernist, 108’s ACDC Lane presence is more measured than its frontage to Flinders Street.Drawing inspiration from the warehouse architecture that has presided over Melbourne’s laneways since early last century, its orthogonal geometry of timber, concrete and glass is both contemporary in form, yet duly deferential of the traditions and values of the past.<BR><BR>True to the spirit of Melbourne laneway culture, the northern façade also integrates both public art, and a culinary hidden gem in the form of 108 ’s ground floor caf&eacute;/restaurant. Furthermore, it provides secure access to 108 round-the-clock, giving residents not one, but two front doors – the first onto mainstream Melbourne via Flinders Street, the second onto the buzz and vibrancy of the city’s network of back streets, lanes and alleys.<BR><BR>The focus of 108 ’s internal architecture centres on an extraordinary courtyard – part outdoor living room, part inner sanctum, this exquisite and enchanting space for 108 residents is situated on the upper ground floor, with the building’s caf&eacute;/restaurant on one side, and its gym and residents’ lounge on the other.<BR><BR>Each apartment at 108 is conceived as a restful haven and calm retreat from the energy and bustle of the CBD. Intended for modern cosmopolitan living, they are open plan design, with spaces that flow and layouts that maximise natural light, views and balcony access. A palette of neutral tones has been selected to engender an elegant yet flexible interior aesthetic, where sophisticated white joinery, natural laminated timber veneers and high quality stone finishes harmonise to create a stylishly serene setting for your home life. <BR><BR>Your kitchen at 108 will be equipped to the highest standards, including Miele appliances, stone bench tops and mirrored splashbacks. While your bathroom will combine the simplicity of dramatic stone with a contrasting mix of light and dark finishes, along with the opulence of designer sanitary ware.<BR>	<!--StartFragment-->
